install neccessary python pakages mentioned in 1st cell
you can secure your notebook so no one else can copy it by making exe file of notebook. but first convert it into .py file 
# instructions :
update chrome and then write command **pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall chromedriver-binary-auto**
you need to create "images" folder where you will set your images.
then you need to know your pc name and it's IPaddress, put these in a pdf file **INFO.pdf** and secure it with password "exe12345".
you have to create a "POSTCODES.txt" file where you store the locations where you have to post your ads.
install pyinstaller for exe file creation then write in command prompt **pyinstaller --onefile hello.py**
If you need any assistance write an **issue** in _issues tab_, i will be more than happy to respond
